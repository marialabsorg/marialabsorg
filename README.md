## 🚧 Current Project: <strong>metroState</strong>

`metroState` is an ambitious urban simulation game where every citizen has intent, every system is interconnected, and every choice carries consequence.

**Core Pillars**:
- 🏙️ **Simulated World**: Dynamic urban life with autonomous citizens and procedural systems.
- 🧠 **Narrative Depth**: Emergent storylines shaped by politics, culture, and player decisions.
- 🧩 **Systems Design**: Advanced AI, modular economy, and city-scale interactivity.
- 🌐 **Tech Stack**: Built in Unreal Engine 5 with C++, Blueprints, and real-time backend services.

> “metroState is not just a city — it’s a living organism. You’re not just playing the game — you’re part of its fabric.”
