## 🌍 About Us

MariaLabs is a systems-focused game and backend studio where software engineering meets social simulation.  
We build experiences that go beyond code — blending architecture, behavior, and storytelling into scalable platforms and immersive worlds.

We believe in crafting **meaningful systems**:  
- 🔧 Systems that simulate  
- 🌐 Systems that scale  
- 📖 Systems that tell stories  

Whether through e-commerce platforms or multiplayer city-sims, our work is built on **clean design, procedural logic, and real-time infrastructure**.

## ✅ Completed Project: <strong>URUS</strong> — *Not Just a Store. An Ecosystem.*

`URUS` is a robust, modular multivendor e-commerce platform built to handle dynamic vendor onboarding, logistics, and customer flow at scale.

### 🎯 Core Objectives
- Create a modular system that vendors can plug into with zero friction  
- Handle high-traffic scenarios while maintaining API responsiveness  
- Offer a backend that reflects real-world store logic with roles, analytics, and secure workflows

### 💡 Key Features
- 🛍️ Vendor storefronts with real-time product/stock sync  
- 💳 Payment flow integration with automated invoicing  
- 🔐 Role-based admin tools (vendor, logistics, support, analytics)  
- ⚙️ Engineered with Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS  
- 📦 Modular codebase for rapid deployment & multi-region scaling

## 🚧 In Progress: <strong>metroState</strong> — *Not Just a Sandbox. A Society.*

`metroState` is a systems-driven, political-social city simulator where AI citizens live, remember, vote, protest, and react dynamically to the player’s decisions.

This is not your average city builder — this is a **society engine**.  
Players don’t just build structures. They build trust, factions, economies, and power hierarchies.

### 🎯 Simulation Goals
- Model believable human behavior across thousands of autonomous agents  
- Integrate politics, economy, memory, and trust into gameplay  
- Build systems that reflect cause-and-effect decision trees  
- Offer server-based persistence across regions and game sessions

### ⚙️ Feature Highlights
- 🏙️ Intent-based procedural AI citizens with memory and goals  
- 🗳️ Dynamic politics and public perception tracking  
- 🧩 Faction systems, law enforcement, and corruption simulations  
- 📡 Real-time multiplayer via region/server architecture  
- 🔌 Backend services for character data, inventory, reputation  
- 🛠 Built in Unity (C#) + custom Node.js-based backend infrastructure

🔜 **Playable alpha will launch with faction management, protests, and procedural citizen AI.**

## 📚 Philosophy & Vision

At MariaLabs, we approach game design and software engineering with the same principles:

1. **Systems Over Scripts** – We favor simulation and rule-based logic over hardcoded outcomes.  
2. **Modular Design** – Everything we build should be reusable, replaceable, and extendable.  
3. **Social Mechanics Matter** – Whether it's citizens in a simulation or vendors in an ecosystem, behavior and relationships drive the experience.  
4. **Backend as a World Engine** – The server isn't just infrastructure—it's part of the story.
